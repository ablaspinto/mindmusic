## Why?
 Many people struggle to find a groove and use music as outlet to help them express themselves. Another obstacle that comes with that is picking specific music that you have overplayed and introduce artists and many others to songs that fit the mood or genre of music that you are interested in.


 ## Who?
* Artists
* Curious people

## How?
>**Motivation:** I am an extremely motivated developer and although I am new to the tech world, I am ready to face any problems that this app may entail.

>**Interest:** Speaking about the app many friends and family have said they would use it, it is a perfect app for a college student trying to find new music or any artist trying to get into new music

>**Collaboration:** I am currently at this moment working with one other developer, although they have less experience, they see the vision and that is what the team needs currently.
